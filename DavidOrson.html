                    <p>After working hard in a few management positions in retail and logistics, I have come to the realisation that I want to switch careers and gain a valuable skill.
                    I feel this will improve my life proffesionally and bring me a greater sense of actualisation. I have always had a preference for analytical work, enjoying 
                    subjects like math, logic and music. Unfortunately, I was made redundant twice in 2018, which gives a greater understanding of the unfortunate position the sector 
                    which I had started to build a career in. I am ambitious and always keen to progress myself in various ways, such as; skills, knowledge, perspective, social and soft 
                    skills, health and fitness. I have shown myself to be a valuable member of the teams I worked in, working diligently to lead by example, maintaining standards, completing 
                    tasks to deadlines and conducting myself in a respectable manner. I am very excited for the opportunities of the growing technology sector and am planning to move to London

                    <p>
                    March last year I completed my first half marathon, in Retford. I researched online to understand what would be required and organised a training structure which i executed.
                    I found that the training was harder than the run itself which allowed me<br> to really enjoy the day and I was surprised that I was capable of finishing the last<br> few miles with
                    a quicker pace than the rest of the race. It has been a lifelong bucketlist dream of mine to run a marathon, so I will be planning towards the goal<br> of running my first this
                    year. I also hope to run a marathon in New York, so, circumstances permitting, I will hope to achieve that this year.<br><br>
                    I also am a keen gamer, playing a modded version of csgo called surfing, you can see an example of this game mode <a>here</a> and <a>this is a link to my youtube channel.</a>
